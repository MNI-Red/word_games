This repo is for the first assignment/task of the 20/21 school year in AT CS. The assignment is as follows: code a bot to play the game of ghost using the scrabble dictionary. The ghost game is a two player alternating game in which the first player to make a legal word longer than the predetermined minimum length loses. 
Thus this game is entirely solvable as:
  it is impartial, 
  has perfect information, 
  is non-random, 
  has normal play,
  has no looping,
  and is finite.
